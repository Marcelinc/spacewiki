    description: 'Spiral galaxies are characterized by their distinctive spiral arms, which wrap around a central bulge. Our very own Milky Way is a prime example of a spiral galaxy. These majestic structures showcase ongoing star formation within their arms, creating stunning cosmic vistas.'

        objectName: 'NGC 1132 Galaxy',
        image: '/images/galaxies/ngc1132.jpg',
    },
    description: 'Elliptical galaxies, as the name suggests, have an elliptical or oval shape. They lack the spiral arms seen in spiral galaxies and are often composed of older stars. Elliptical galaxies can range from nearly spherical to highly elongated, and they play a crucial role in the cosmic web of galaxy clusters.'

        objectName: 'NGC 2337 Galaxy',
        image: '/images/galaxies/ngc2337.jpg',
    },
    description: 'Irregular galaxies defy the typical symmetrical shapes seen in spiral and elliptical galaxies. They can take on a chaotic, asymmetric appearance and are often the result of gravitational interactions or mergers between galaxies. Irregular galaxies are a testament to the dynamic nature of the cosmos.'

    example: {
        objectName: 'NGC 6861 Galaxy',
        image: '/images/galaxies/ngc6861.jpg',
    },
    description: 'Lenticular galaxies combine features of both spiral and elliptical galaxies. They possess a central bulge like elliptical galaxies but also exhibit a flat, disk-like structure similar to spiral galaxies. Lenticular galaxies are sometimes referred to as "disk ellipticals."'

    typeName: 'Dwarf Galaxies',
    example: {
        objectName: 'I Zwicky 18 Galaxy',
        image: '/images/galaxies/IZwicky18.jpg',
    },
    description: 'Dwarf galaxies are smaller and less luminous than their larger counterparts. They can be found in abundance throughout the universe and often orbit larger galaxies as satellites. Despite their diminutive size, dwarf galaxies contribute significantly to our understanding of cosmic structure and evolution.'
},{
    id:6,
    typeName: 'Barred Spiral Galaxies',
    example: {
        objectName: 'M109 Galaxy',
        image: '/images/galaxies/m109.jpg',
    },
    description: 'Barred spiral galaxies feature a central bar-shaped structure extending from the nucleus. The arms of the spiral galaxy emerge from the ends of this bar. The presence of a bar can influence the dynamics of the galaxy and the distribution of stars.'
